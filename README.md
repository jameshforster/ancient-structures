# Ancient Structures

Scattered across the world, impenetrable fortresses from a bygone age sit awaiting an intrepid explorer to uncover their secrets. Some lay in ruins, others almost pristine. All may contain great treasures, magic, artifacts or even lost technology. If you wish to discover what lies within, you must brave traps and puzzles that test your worthiness. That is, if you can enter at all.

## Features

### Existing

### Planned

<u>Multiple Temple Types</u><br>
From ruined, intact and futuristic models, multiple different temples each with their own unique style and difficulty.

<u>Puzzles</u><br>
From simple locking mechanisms to fiendish riddles, the only way to the rewards is to follow the clues.

<u>Challenges</u><br>
Not everything can be solved with the mind alone! Feats of athleticism, survival and awareness will get you through intact.

<u>Custom Builds</u><br>
Build your own temples and craft the variety of blocks into your own secure stronghold. Once you are happy you can lock in your design so that it becomes as impenetrable as the main structures, and even then unlock it to make further updates.

<u>Rewards</u><br>
Special mod based rewards reacting to other available mods or even your own custom defined rewards. It's all down to you.
